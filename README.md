# eRDFAnalyser
eRDF Analyser is an interactive and integrated tool for electron reduced density function analysis. This tool allows users to input an electron diffraction pattern (obtained from a TEM) and guides them interactively through the process of fitting and extracting the reduced density function (RDF) for their material. It currently works for material compositions with up to 5 elements.
