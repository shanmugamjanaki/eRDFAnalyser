# eRDFAnalyser
v1.1.0 [16/11/2016]

eRDF Analyser is an interactive and integrated tool for electron reduced density function analysis. This tool allows users to input an electron diffraction pattern (obtained from a TEM) and guides them interactively through the process of fitting and extracting the reduced density function (RDF) for their material. It currently works for material compositions with up to 5 elements.

This tool is available as open source code and in open executable form (both covered under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3). 

eRDFAnalyser GUI can be run in MATLAB - version 1.1 was written in R2015a/b and has been tested up to R2016a. The executable (.exe on Windows only) requires MATLAB Runtime version 9.0 (2015b) to run - this can be downloaded from http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html (one-time installation).
