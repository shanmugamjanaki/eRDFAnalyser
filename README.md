# eRDFAnalyser
Latest release: v1.0 [05/01/2017]

eRDF Analyser is an interactive and integrated tool for electron reduced density function analysis. This tool allows users to input an electron diffraction pattern (obtained from a TEM) and guides them interactively through the process of fitting and extracting the reduced density function (RDF) for their material. It currently works for material compositions with up to 5 elements.

This tool is available as open source code and in open executable form (both covered under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3). The GUI was built in MATLAB R2015a/b on Windows OS and is optimised for a 15" screen. Compatibility with older/newer versions is not guaranteed although it has been tested on R2014a-R2016b on Windows/Mac OS. 

eRDF Analyser GUI requires the following files to run: 'RDF_Analyser_GUI.fig', 'RDF_Analyser_GUI.m', 'Kirkland_2010'.txt and 'Lobato_2014.txt'. All files can be found in Release Downloads (Source Code). The executable (eRDFAnalyser.exe) runs on Windows OS only. It requires MATLAB Runtime version 9.0 (2015b) to run - this can be downloaded from http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html (one-time installation).
